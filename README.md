Physicist, data enthusiast, sci-fi, and sports geek. I have a great passion for playing with data, and figuring out how the world works through that. 
Though my formal education is in physics, I learned data manipulation and coding skills mostly from self-education and through online resources. 

Hit me up for any collaboration invite, open-source project or just to share the experience in data driven world.
